            <br />
            <p className="text-secondary font-rosario text-lg lg:w-2/3">It happened on a random day in 2017-2018, I stumbled upon <i>web development</i>. I was 8 at the time and I was (still am) a really creative child. I started to make stuff with html and css only at that time. Then, I lost my <i>flow</i> due to school and some personal problems (Average Asian situation) 
            <br /><br />
            However, after 2021, I got back to web design again and started making ramdom side projects. It was like a side quest to me (now it&apos;s my <strong>main quest</strong>). After school resumed, I again lost my flow and didn&apos;t return until 2023. And hopefully it was my last break from web development. 
            <br /><br />
            Now here I am, learning full-stack development. I am always open to learning new technologies, I love it!
